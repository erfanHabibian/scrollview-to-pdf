# scrollview-to-pdf
This is where you get the knowledge of converting any kind of view to single page or multiple pages PDF file.
The only file you must get is the scrollViewToPDF.zip file.
After that import the android studio file into your device and there you can run it on your device and see how it is working.
I hope you can find how it works.
Gook luck...
